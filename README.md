Python Image Tool - a tkinter based CVIPtools like application for image processing.

## What is pyimgtool?
It's a tkinter based GUI application to perform image processing.

## What can pyimgtool do?
The application let's you load image files (PIL supported) and perform operations -
* Basic
  * Flip the image
  * Convert to grayscale
  * Undo an operation
  * Save as (a PNG file)
* Blur/sharpen
  * Gaussian, Mean filters
  * PIL ImageFilter filters
* Edge detection
  * Laplacian, Sobel operators
* Thresholding
  * Fixed threshold
  * Otsu threshold - binary and otherwise
* Morphological
  * Erosion, dilation

The OO design nature of this application allows easy addition of operations and code refactoring (maybe from PIL to OpenCV)

## Why pyimgtool?
A fast track way to observe an image and operations performed on it. The idea for this application came during my senior year, after I completed a course in Computer Vision, where I learned about a lot of the operations included here. I've also wanted to implement a multi-window tkinter application with shared namespaces (just for fun), so I figured, might as well go for an application of this nature.

## Requirements
* Python3 (tested on 3.6.7)
* numpy (tested on 1.19.1)
* Pillow (tested on 7.2.0)

## Installation, usage and modifications
* Clone the repo, change directory, install the requirements and run `python main.py`
  * If you're using `pip`, install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Modifications can be done via the ImageWindow class in `image_window.py` by adding methods as specified (check comments)
* For readability, clarity and refactor purposes, the actual image manipulation code is specified in `image_manip.py`

## Create an executable

Make `pyimgtool` work out of the box, by creating an executable.

```shell
pip install pyinstaller # if you don't have it installed already
cd <your-path>/pyimgtool # or the directory that you clone this project in
pyinstaller main.py -F --onefile
```
Find the executable in the `dist` folder.

For more information on creating executables, [read the docs](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html).
